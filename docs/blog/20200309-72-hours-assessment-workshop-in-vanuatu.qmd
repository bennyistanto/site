Trip to Port Vila - Vanuatu last week was my first trip to Pacific Islands. 10 hours flight in total from Jakarta with stop in Sydney, Australia.

With colleague from Fiji, I run a workshop and stakeholder meeting to identify key food security and demographic vulnerability indicators for the country, and conduct the 72-hour assessment tool workshop with the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and the Food Security and Livelihood Cluster (FSLC) members. Very happy to see all the participant from Government agencies, International NGO and others are excited to follow the workshop and learn on how QGIS could be use during emergency situation.

Port Vila can be categorised as a safe city, low crime rate, you can staying up late at night near the beach or inside the bar, and residents who are friendly to foreigners. Was a pleasant experience.

In the weekend, I went to Blue Lagoon, but unfortunately I can not visit the very famous Mount Yasur in Tanna Island, is an easily accessible active volcano, and is a major Vanuatu tourist attraction. Maybe next time!
