According to Wikipedia, ***Ikigai*** (生き甲斐) (pronounced [[ikiɡai]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Japanese "Help:IPA/Japanese")) is a [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language") concept that means "a reason for being". The word refers to having a meaningful direction or purpose in life, constituting the sense of one's life being made worthwhile, with actions (spontaneous and willing) taken towards achieving one's *ikigai* resulting in satisfaction and a sense of [meaning to life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life "Meaning of life").

And here’s my version of Ikigai:

* I **LOVE** drawing and coloring, especially a map since I was a kid.
* I am **GOOD AT** turning data into maps for actionable, life-saving insights.
* I work as a crisis mapper and get **PAID FOR** it.
* I share the ideas of helping others and contributing to humanitarian **NEEDS** is as simple as I do.

How about you?
