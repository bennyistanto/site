As you may have heard, I’m moving on to the World Bank HQ after [9 wonderful years](/blog/20210611-ninth-year-and-the-2020-nobel-peace-prize-laureate) at the UN WFP in Indonesia. I started my career with WFP on [11 June 2012](/blog/20120611-first-day-at-wfp).

Today is my last working days, I am visiting the office to clean up my things. Yes, this is my first time back to the office again since “[working from home](/blog/20210311-today-a-year-ago)” mode started on March 11, 2020.

Looking forward to doing more meaningful work in climate analytics and geospatial technology for greater impact.
