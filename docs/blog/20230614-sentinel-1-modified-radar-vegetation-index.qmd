The Sentinel-1 modified Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) script below originally developed by my friend Jose Manuel Delgado Blasco ([Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TwtlI-UAAAAJ), [Linkedin](https://it.linkedin.com/in/josemanuel-delgadoblasco)) as part of our team (GOST) activities to support during Ukraine response last year, published as GOST Public Good’s Github repo <https://github.com/worldbank/GOST_SAR/tree/master/Radar_Vegetation_Index>

The original GEE script was meant to be used only for individual updates, as time progresses and the need for vegetation monitoring continually increases, I believe it's necessary to obtain this RVI time-series data, which can be matched with monthly rainfall time-series data for monitoring food crop phenology.

For this reason, I've added a function to mosaic every ten days and [batch downloading](/blog/20220319-batch-task-execution-in-google-earth-engine-code-editor) if the list of data is quite extensive.

All credit goes to the awesome work of Jose Manuel! Hats off to him!
