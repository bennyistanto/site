For the last 6 weeks, I am working with my colleagues in Bangkok and Dili to produces climate monitoring bulletin related to dry season in the last 2019 and start of rainy season for 2019-2020. The bulletin has already been published and is accessible online via <https://www.wfp.org/publications/wfp-timor-leste-rainy-season-2019-2020>.
