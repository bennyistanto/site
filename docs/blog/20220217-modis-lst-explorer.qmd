Recently I worked on utilising daily MODIS LST ([MOD11A1](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod11a1v006/)) to calculate number of day in a year with LST exceeding 35degC. At some point curious about the daily coverage of MODIS has pixel with good data quality.

So, I wrote a Google Earth Engine script to see visual differences between applying QC Bitmask and the original based on daily data.
