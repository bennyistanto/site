For the month of November, [Topi Tjukanov](https://twitter.com/tjukanov) announced a 30 Day Map Challenge on Twitter.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="960"]![ Source:  https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge   ](../assets/image-blog/20201101-30-day-map-challenge-30.jpg) Source: https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge [/caption]

The idea is to create (and publish) maps based on different themes on each day of the month using the hashtag [#30DayMapChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge), you can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps from specific topics on specific days listed below. Just include a picture of the map when you post to Twitter with the hashtag.

You don't have to sign up anywhere to participate. There are no restrictions on the tools, technologies and the data you use in your maps. Doing less than 30 is also fine (and actually doing all 30 is really hard!).

As I don’t have Twitter account, so I would like to publish through this blogpost and update it every day.

**Happy mapping!**

**Day 13** of [#30DayMapChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge?src=hashtag_click) – Raster

Landsat 8 RGB true-color composite. Path/Row 119/65.

By using ImageMagick (free and open-source cross-platform software suite for displaying, creating, converting, modifying, and editing raster images), to get something that looks like land looks, we need to increase both brightness and contrast. Most well-known method is the -sigmoidal-contrast flag for convert, which takes a two-part argument: a scale factor for the contrast, plus the brightness value in the input image that should end up at 50% (midtone) in the output image. We can take the haze into account by lowering the blue channel’s gamma (brightness) slightly, and raising the red channel’s even less, before increasing the contrast. This gives us something that’s green where it should be green.
