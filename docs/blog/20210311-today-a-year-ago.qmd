Today marks the [first anniversary of my office’s decision](/blog/20200311-covid-19-and-wfh) to asks all staffs to work from home (WFH) due to COVID-19.

This means a lot for me and changed the way on how everybody works. For me, WFH means an escape from wasting my lives commuting from Bogor - Jakarta - Bogor. I have done the maths, on average, Jakarta/Bogor commuters spend 30 days a year traveling to and from work.

Some fun stuff during WFH too, I can:

* Teach my daughter how to code using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), and now we are starting to use [Lua](http://www.lua.org)
* Replace my wife’s duty, frequently buy vegetables and recipes at the vegetable vendors or local market
* Netflix movie marathon

The pandemic still not over, please stay at home, stay healthy and wear your mask. I know wearing a mask is not a political right, but it respect other lives.
