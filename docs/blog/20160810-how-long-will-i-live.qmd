What's my place in the world population? How long will I live?

![](../assets/image-blog/20160810-how-long-will-i-live-01.jpg)

[Population.io](https://population.io/) aims to make demography – the study of human populations – accessible to a wider audience. Below is the summary:

* I was older than 59.6% of all people in the world and 62.8% in Indonesia.
* My next milestone is 5 Sep 2022 then I’ll be 5th billionth person to be alive in the world.
* I share a birthday with about 298,427 people around the world and that approximately 12,300 people were born in the same hour.
* The website estimate that I will live until 21 Jan 2061 if I was an average world citizen. Whereas in Indonesia it would be until 17 Nov 2055, age 73.6 years.
* Or maybe I could live even longer if I moved to Japan, they estimate I will live until age 86.1 years or 12.5 years longer.
