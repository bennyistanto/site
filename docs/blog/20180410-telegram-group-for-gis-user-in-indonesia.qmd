A group of friends and me run a Telegram group discussion about GIS and Remote Sensing application, currently focusing on Indonesia context and has been participated by more than 900 GIS practitioners (as of 10 April 2018).

As of now, there has been 31 sessions conducted. Presentations were delivered voluntary by a number of participants, covering the topic of SDG application, spatial model, web-map, UAV, etc. Feel free to join at this [link](https://t.me/gis_id).
