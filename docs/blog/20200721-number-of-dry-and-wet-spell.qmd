Now, it’s easy to get statistics information on AVERAGE, MINIMUM and MAXIMUM number of consecutive dry and wet days for a certain period using Google Earth Engine platform. Copy below code and paste into GEE.

You can modify:

* Bounding box or area of interest
* Start and End of YEAR, MONTH and DATE
* Precipitation threshold which can be considered as rain day.
* Symbology as SLD style
* Palette
