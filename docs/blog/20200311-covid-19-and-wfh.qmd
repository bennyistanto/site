I was in [Vanuatu](/blog/20200309-72-hours-assessment-workshop-in-vanuatu) when President Joko Widodo [announced](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/02/breaking-jokowi-announces-indonesias-first-two-confirmed-covid-19-cases.html) the first two confirmed cased in Indonesia. Yesterday, I returned to the office after a week-long mission and only spent a few hours there to wrap up some pending work. Then the Country Director told me to start working from home tomorrow.

I think this is only temporary, maybe for a week or two, so I didn’t bring my equipment home. We’ll see how it goes.
