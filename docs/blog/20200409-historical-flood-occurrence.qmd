Inspired from [Dr. Ate Poortinga](https://sig-gis.com/sig-people/ate-poortinga/)’s work in extracting [water occurrence](https://code.earthengine.google.com/083a6f9a981d2737d8eac16cbe8505b0) from satellite image, I tried to do similar analysis to get historical average of flood occurrence by month. The result from this analysis will be added as a probability information to enhance WFP's VAMPIRE flood alert system (Extreme rainfall-triggering flood) that currently I am working on.

The steps below describe how to extract monthly water occurrence and seasonality water using Google Earth Engine code editor.

**Step 1.** Define geographic domain

**Step 2.** Import JRC Global Surface Water and extract permanent water from Seasonality layer

**Step 3.** Define study period (example: extract January data from 1984 - 2018)

**Step 4.** Detect all observation data with water

**Step 5.** Calculate flood occurrence

**Step 6.** Visualisation and add map to canvas

**Step 7.** Export the result to Google Drive

**Step 8.** Setting legend
