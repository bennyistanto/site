Today marks my [ninth](/blog/20120611-first-day-at-wfp) year working with the UN World Food Programme, I feel honoured because this has been beyond a profession, but I found my definition of [ikigai](/blog/20201109-a-reason-for-being) (A Reason for Being).

* I LOVE drawing and coloring, especially map since I was a kid
* I am GOOD AT turning data into maps for actionable and live-saving insight WFP are delivering
* as one of crisis mapper at WFP, I GET PAID for it, of course
* with WFP, I share the ideas of helping others and contribute to humanitarian NEEDS is as simple as I do

Last year, WFP was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize! This completes my achievement at WFP: as the best GIS in the 1st WFP GIS Community Award in 2015, and with VAM team won 2017 WFP Innovation Challenge, for [VAMPIRE](/projects/2016-vampire) works.

Thank you WFP!

***Looking forward to doing more meaningful work in climate analytics and geospatial technology for greater impact.***
