Have you heard about [Aerial Bold](http://type.aerial-bold.com/tw/)? - a project from [Benedikt Groß](https://benedikt-gross.de/projects/the-aerial-bold-project/) & [Joey Lee](https://jk-lee.com/projects/aerial-bold/), devoted to finding all the human-built letters of the world. The idea was to pore over satellite imagery to locate architectural ABCs, then turn those images into a font. Wired also discussed [this](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/aerial-bold-clever-typeface-crafted-satellite-shots-buildings/).

Here's the example of my daughter's name using Aerial Bold. If you are curious, yes it's real, W letter in the picture comes from Rosenhof Berlin-Zehlendorf Seniorenwohnanlage Betriebsgesellschaft mbH, Schlettstadter Straße 22, 14169 Berlin, Germany. <https://maps.app.goo.gl/TYBs856cSeDM9imz9>
