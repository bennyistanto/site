The World Meteorological Organization ([WMO](https://public.wmo.int/en)), defines a heat wave as five or more consecutive days of prolonged heat in which the daily maximum temperature is higher than the average maximum temperature by 5°C (9°F) or more.

To measure the heat wave index, one of recommendation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch)) was to use the heat wave duration index (HWDI). This index has been defined as as the maximum period in each year of at least 5 consecutive days where the maximum temperature is at least 5°C warmer than the daily climatology.

### How-to?

To calculate the HWDI, you need to have timeseries daily maximum temperature data and tools to calculate the index. Please follow below procedure to get started.

#### Tools

1. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install. Since Climate Data Operator (CDO) is not available for Windows, the easiest way to use it is via the WSL. If you are on Linux/macOS, then you are good to go.
2. Anaconda or Miniconda
3. Climate Data Operator (CDO) - https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo, installed using *conda install -c conda-forge cdo*. Please create a new environment to install CDO, just to make sure the CDO will not breaking your current python environment.

#### Data

1. Global high resolution (30 arc sec ~ 1km) daily maximum temperature data (`tasmax`), 1979 - 2016, available as 1 month data per 1 file, from CHELSA - https://chelsa-climate.org/, downloaded from https://data.isimip.org/datasets/92b05291-fbe5-4ed2-b3df-29ff0cded9f2/.

#### Case

California, US

#### Step-by-step

Lets start!

NOTE

* To follow below step, you need to download CHELSA *tasmax* data from above link. Total size for *tasmax* data is 1.2TB, please make sure you have bandwidth and unlimited data package
* Or you can proceed directly to step 2, using pre-computed result for step 1 which is available in folder [01\_tasmax](https://github.com/bennyistanto/heatwave-index/tree/main/california/01_tasmax), with size 9.75GB.
* Also make sure you have plenty of storage. Step 2 and 3 will produce intermediate output each around 40GB, step 4 and 5 each around 80GB, step 6 around 2GB and step 7 around 430MB.

1. Clip global data using bounding box

   ```
   for fl in ./00_chelsa_global_tasmax/*.nc; do cdo sellonlatbox,-8.3,-7.6,12.3,12.9 $fl ./01_tasmax_/usa_california_`basename $fl`; done
   ```
2. Merge monthly data into annual

   ```
   for year in {1979..2016}; do cdo mergetime ./01_tasmax/usa_california_chelsa-w5e5v1.0_obsclim_tasmax_30arcsec_global_daily_${year}??.nc ./02_tasmax_annual/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmax_${year}.nc; done
   ```
3. Delete data who has 29th February.

   According to <https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/boards/2/topics/9522>, dealing with leap years in climate model output has caused many scientists to stumble, since there are just about 25% February 29ths in the time series so that the sample size for February 29th is just not big enough. Therefore, remove it from the time series before analysing it.

   ```
   for year in {1979..2016}; do cdo -delete,month=2,day=29 ./02_tasmax_annual/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmax_${year}.nc ./03_tasmax_del29feb/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmax_${year}.nc; done
   ```

   below script also works, using `del29dfeb`

   ```
   for year in {1979..2016}; do cdo -del29feb ./02_tasmax_annual/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmax_${year}.nc ./03_tasmax_del29feb/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmax_${year}.nc; done
   ```
4. Convert Kelvin to degree Celsius and don't forget to change the variable (here `tasmax`) units, too. Combining operators:

   ```
   for year in {1979..2016}; do cdo -b 32 -setattribute,tasmax@units="degC" -addc,-273.15 ./03_tasmax_del29feb/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmax_${year}.nc ./04_tasmax_celsius/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmax_${year}.nc; done
   ```
5. Merge all nc files result from point 4 into single nc.

   ```
   cdo mergetime ./04_tasmax_celsius/usa_*.nc ./05_tasmax_all/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmax_1979_2016.nc
   ```
6. Calculate the mean TXnorm of daily maximum temperatures for any period used as reference

   ```
   cdo ydrunmean,5,rm=c ./05_tasmax_all/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmax_1979_2016.nc ./06_tasmax_meanofreference/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmaxnorm_ref_1979_2016.nc
   ```
7. Calculate annual heat wave duration index w.r.t mean of reference period

   ```
   for year in {1979..2016}; do cdo eca_hwdi ./04_tasmax_celsius/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmax_${year}.nc ./06_tasmax_meanofreference/usa_california_chelsa_daily_tasmaxnorm_ref_1979_2016.nc ./07_hwdi/usa_california_chelsa_daily_hwdi_${year}.nc; done
   ```
