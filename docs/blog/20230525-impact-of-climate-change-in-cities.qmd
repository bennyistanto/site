A new World Bank report is [launched](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/thriving), in which I had the opportunity to contribute the analysis.

The report examining the two-way relationship between cities and climate change, including valuable insights to help cities boost resilience and thrive, both now and in the future.

The team are utilizing temperature and precipitation based index: SPEI, SPI, CDD, CWD, number of annual hotdays and annual mean temperature, distance and magnitude of tropical cyclone to the city center, to support the analysis which organized into four inter-related workstreams:

* Who is affected?
* Stressor that make urban development less green.
* Stressors that make urban development less resilient.
* Stressors that make urban development less inclusive.
