### Information Management in Emergency Situation

 During post-disaster emergency response, the role of information management is highly important. Data and information exchange happens very fast, and everybody needs all kinds of information in regard with the disaster. Most often, up-to-date and reliable information are scarce at the beginning of emergency response. Good Information Management is very crucial to ensure timely dissemination of information. The information management steps that should be followed include collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of data and information.

**Google Code:** Google Code is Google's site for developer tools, APIs and technical resources. Google Sites does support custom gadgets feature that can be added to websites hosted on Google Sites. Gadget is essentially a programming interface with custom code that can be embedded and used to provide content to iGoogle homepage and websites hosted on Google Sites. As a workaround, gadgets can be used to add, include or insert JavaScript (JS) code and other content that is otherwise prohibited.

In Mentawai Response website, we used some social networks and other plugins to promote our website in International and National Humanitarian forum i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Whos Amung Us and AddThis Analytics. All these plugins contain Javascript in their components, so it does not work if included in the Google Sites, to overcome this, a simple XML script was created using Google Gadgets Editor which was accessible on Google Code.

* On first login, an example code of “Hello World” will be displayed, as show below:

*<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
<Module>  
<ModulePrefs title="hello world example" />  
<Content type="html"><![CDATA[  
Hello, world!  
]]></Content>  
</Module>*

* Remove the line of Hello, world! and replace it with the custom code.
* Name the gadget by changing the hello world example in the line of ModulePrefs.
