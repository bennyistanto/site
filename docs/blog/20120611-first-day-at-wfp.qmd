Today is my first day working at World Food Programme, Indonesia Country Office and based in Jakarta. I will work under Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping Unit as a GIS Programme Officer. I am happy moving back to Jakarta after spend almost 6 years working in the field.

Since few months ago I am looking for a new job in Jakarta because my wife will back home soon from the Netherlands. I think it was a good reason to restart my life together.

Since morning I am dealing with administrative issue and some mandatory training for new UN staff. I am really excited to start my work, as I will utilized my expertise on climate analytics, combined with GIS on food security issue.

Wish me luck!
