Since it was announced through Development Seed’s [blog](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2011-02-16-announcing-tilemill-a-modern-map-design-studio-powered-by-open-source), I am really excited to try [TileMill](http://tilemill.com) and [TileStream](https://github.com/mapbox/tilestream). Currently I am living in remote area where internet connection bit a problem. But luckily I have a [friend](http://utian.azoebs.com) who is happy to send me a CD containing the pre-installed Virtual Box Image (VDI) with RedHatLinux, including TileMill.

Then finally Development Seed team [released](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/aug/09/tilemill-040-released/) 0.4.0 installer for Mac OS X, makes me more even excited to try both TileMill and TileStream.

Below is my project to visualize Aceh terrain.

And next picture is TileStream running in my local Mac

Currently I am trying to visualize 2010 Indonesia Land Cover data from Ministry of Forestry. Below is the MSS code:

I am very satisfied with the result from TileMill and how the mbtiles loaded in TileStream: FAST.

New cartographic technique using new technology.
